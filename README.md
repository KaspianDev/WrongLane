WrongLane is a game designed for Sprig.  
You play as a car which driver in an opposite direction to other cars and you have to avoid crashing into them.  
There are 3 difficulty levels: Normal, Hard, Hardcore.  
Every difficulty level has different car speed and higher density on road so it's harder to avoid crashing. Additionally you get a different amount of lives, 3 for Normal, 2 for Hard and 1 for Hardcore.
